# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This is a simple day planner that saves user input to local storage so that next time you load this site, you can see what you have scheduled for future reference. The planner shows the time for a regular work day, from 9am - 5pm. In the jumbotron, there is a live clock updating every second. The planner also keeps track of what time it is during the day. It has color coded the time blocks accordingly: past - grey; present - green; future - red. This was done using the Moment.js CDN.
